1,Ebola Sudan,Sudan,Nzara (Cotton Factory),6,11,1976,1976,4.63912,28.25115,point,"Ref 100 state the 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper. Our own lat & long checked and confirmed in GE and against Ref 3 map (Fig 1). Ref 100 states that, 'Occurrences of unknown origin were excluded from analysis, but when reasonable guesses could be made as to point or general area of origin they were included. Although the geographic coordinates may not fix the exposure point precisely, they represent the review paper's best guess as to its position and are likely to be representative of the coarse-scale ecologic conditions'.

2,Ebola Zaire,DRC/ Zaire,Yambuku village (index),8,10,1976,1976,2.82535,22.22567,point,"Ref 100 state the 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper.  We used our own coords to accurate reflect the village position. Our lat & long checked and confirmed in GE and against Ref 2 map (Fig 3). Ref 100  states that, 'Occurrences of unknown origin were excluded from analysis, but when reasonable guesses could be made as to point or general area of origin they were included. Although the geographic coordinates may not fix the exposure point precisely, they represent the review paper's best guess as to its position and are likely to be representative of the coarse-scale ecologic conditions'. "
3,Ebola Zaire,DRC/ Zaire,Bonduni village (20km east of Tanda),6,6,1977,1977,,,polygon,Ref 100 states the 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper. We used our own lat & long which were checked and confirmed in GE and against Ref 10 map (Fig 2). Because we can not be 100% certain where the village is along the road we suggest a 5km radius drawn around the excel coords.
4,Ebola Sudan,Sudan,Nzara town,7,10,1979,1979,4.63912,28.25115,point,"Ref 100 states the 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper. We used our own lat & long which were checked and confirmed in GE. Article 100 coords are 0.5km from the hospital where the index case first presented (Nzara General Hospital). Ref 100 also states that, 'Occurrences of unknown origin were excluded from analysis, but when reasonable guesses could be made as to point or general area of origin they were included. Although the geographic coordinates may not fix the exposure point precisely, they represent the review paper's best guess as to its position and are likely to be representative of the coarse-scale ecologic conditions'. "
5,Ebola Ivory Coast,Cote d'Ivoire,Tai National Park,11,11,1994,1994,,,polygon,"Ref 100 states the 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper. We used our own lat & long which were checked and confirmed in GE and against Ref 7 map (Fig 1). The excel coords represent the centroid of the chimpanze home range. A 5km radius should be drawn around the excel coords to capture the chimps homerange.  Our coords are around 12km from the town of Tai. Ref 100 also states that, 'Occurrences of unknown origin were excluded from analysis, but when reasonable guesses could be made as to point or general area of origin they were included. Although the geographic coordinates may not fix the exposure point precisely, they represent the review paper's best guess as to its position and are likely to be representative of the coarse-scale ecologic conditions'. "
6,Ebola Zaire,Gabon,Mekouka and Andock mining camps,11,2,1994,1995,,,polygon,Original paper 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper for Mekouka and Andock. These coords were used. The paper coords were checked and confirmed in GE and against Ref 8 map (Fig 1). A polygon needs to be drawn around Mekouka and Andock as we can not be sure whether the index case came from the Mekouka or Andock camp.
7,Ebola Zaire,DRC,Mwembe (15km from Kikwit),1,7,1995,1995,,,polygon,"Ref 100 states the 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper. We used our own lat & long which were checked and confirmed in GE and against the paper's description ('Collecting charcoal in Mwembe, 15 km from his residence in Kikwit'). Because we could not find 'Mwembe' we drew a polygon around Kikwit that had a 15km radius."
8,Ebola Zaire,Gabon,Mayibout 2 (index),1,3,1996,1996,1.11667,13.1,point,Original paper coords were checked and confirmed in GE and against the paper's Ref 8 map (Fig 1).

11,Ebola Zaire,Gabon,Memdemba,10,3,2001,2002,0.70055,14.15543,point,"The original paper gave the name of the villages and GE and the article map were used to geo-ref. Ref 100 also states the 'apparent origin' and give coords within the paper. Article 100 lat & long checked and confirmed to be near Ekata (3.5km north of the GE marker for Ekata). Ref 100 also states that, 'Occurrences of unknown origin were excluded from analysis, but when reasonable guesses could be made as to point or general area of origin they were included.

Accorinding to Ref 130, 'The first index case was probably infected during a hunt near Yembelangoye village on 21 December 2002'. The excel coords represent the GE marker for Yembelangoye village which is in the correct area as described by Ref 130."
18,Ebola Zaire,Republic of the Congo,"Site 2  (Kéllé district, Cuvette Ouest)",12,4,2002,2003,,,polygon,The 2rd index case location was not reported but we are confident it is around the Lossi Animal reserve. A polygon was drawn around the excel coords to represent the potential hunting range.

Can not find camp in GE or GM but confident it is around the Lossi Animal reserve. A polygon was drawn around the excel coords to represent the potential hunting range

21,Ebola Sudan,Sudan (South Sudan),Forest 40km South of Yambio town,4,6,2004,2004,,,polygon,"The search term, 'Yambio, South Sudan' was used in GE and then a forest in DRC which was 40km away from Yambio was geo-referenced. A polygon needs to be drawn around this forest area"
22,Ebola Zaire,Republic of the Congo,Odzala National Park (Etoumbi),4,5,2005,2005,,,polygon,"It appears the first zoonotic infection was on a hunting trip into the Parc d'Odzala. The excel coords represent the centroid of the park, however it is my belief that the park is also made up of the 'Reserve de Faune de la Lekoli-Pandaka' and the 'Domdine de Chasse de Mboko' parks which should also be incluced in the polygon boundry."
23,Ebola Zaire,DRC,Bamoukamba 2 (index),5,11,2007,2007,-5.25956,21.40954,point,"According to Ref 131 the index case came from Ndongo 2 village howewer a man came into direct contact with the blood of the bats he had bought from the Mombo Mounene 2 market reported having mild symptoms (mainly fever and headache) sometimes during this period. This man was the father of a 4-year-old girl (patient B), who suddenly fell ill on 12 June and died on 16 June 2007.   'Mombo Mounene 2 market' was not stored in GMs or GE. Therefore we used GE and the article map to decide where the market was. We picked a location just after the bend in the road.  For accuracy a polygon need to be drawn with a radius of 3km from the excel coords. "
24,Ebola Bundibugyo,Uganda,"Kabango village (Kasitu subcounty, Bundibugyo district) (index)",8,1,2007,2008,0.7706,30.13041,point,"According to Ref 115, 'The putative index patient was a 26-year-old woman from Kabango village, Kasitu subcounty, in Bundibugyo district'. GE search term 'Kabango Senior Secondary School, Uganda' was used to then find the town's coords across the road. The school appears to be within 1km of the village and therfore a point was chosen."

They are polygons because the information is not related to the index case but the outbreak in general. Therefore a polygon needs to be drawn matching the the geographic limits of Luebo."

Therefore a polygon around Busika needs to be drawn to reflect the index case location. Please see Ref 109 (Fig 1) for more information."
27,Ebola Bundibugyo,DRC,Isiro health zone  (index),6,11,2012,2012,,,polygon,"No geographical information on index case. GE search term 'Province Orientale, DRC' to generate centroid coords. A polygon needs to be drawn matching the the geographic limits of  'Province Orientale, DRC'."
