## Code pipeline for Gibb et al, "The anthropogenic fingerprint on emerging infectious diseases".

Code is contained within the "scripts" folder and stored within 5 subfolders: 
 
 ↳ 00_hypothesis_exercise → Scripts to process coauthor-completed hypothesis exercise
 
 ↳ 01_disease_data_processing → Scripts to pre-process and harmonize all disease outbreak event data sources
 
 ↳ 02_covariate_data_processing → Scripts to pre-process certain covariate data when required
 
 ↳ 03_modelling → Scripts to run geospatial modelling pipelines (global all diseases; individual pipelines for each disease)
 
 ↳ 04_results → Scripts to summarise across models and output figures and key results

Publically-shareable disease datasets (i.e. open datasets) will be moved over to this repository.

Model outputs for each disease (csvs of fitted posterior parameter estimates) for individual disease models are stored in "outputs" folder.

 ↳ output → model_outputs → disease_params
